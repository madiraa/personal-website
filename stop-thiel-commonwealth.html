      <h1>Stop Thiel @ Commonwealth Club</h1>
      
      <p><strong>URGENT:</strong> The Commonwealth Club is hosting Peter Thiel for a lecture series on September 22nd, 29th, and October 6th. We need to demand they cancel the remaining events.</p>

      <div class="call-script">
        <h3>üìù What to Say</h3>
        
        <div class="script-section">
          <p>"Hi, my name is <strong>[YOUR NAME]</strong> and I live in <strong>[LOCATION]</strong>. I'm calling to urge the Commonwealth Club to cancel the remaining Peter Thiel lecture events scheduled for September 22nd, 29th, and October 6th."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="script-section">
          <p>"Peter Thiel's company Palantir provides the technology that enables ICE to track people, round them up, and lock them in modern-day concentration camps. That same technology fuels the genocide in Gaza and powers mass surveillance of the public. Thiel's stated opposition to democracy and Palantir's technologies directly contradict the Commonwealth Club's mission to support democratic values and social good."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="script-section">
          <p>"I, and groups of civic leaders, clergy members, and concerned residents demand that you cancel the remaining events and take a public stand against platforming someone whose work actively harms communities."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="optional-section">
          <h4>Optional Addition:</h4>
          <p>"Commonwealth Club has repeatedly stated that it is 'not hosting, sponsoring or endorsing the lectures by Peter Thiel.' This is nonsense. By providing the venue, you're absolutely hosting and legitimizing this content. The Commonwealth Club's name and reputation is attached to this event. You have a choice about who gets to use your platform, and right now you're choosing to platform someone who opposes the values in your mission statement and harms the democracy you claim to value."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="script-section">
          <p>"The Commonwealth Club needs to cancel all future Thiel events. Thank you."</p>

      </div>

        <h3>üìû Who to Call</h3>
        <p>Call these Commonwealth Club leaders and demand they cancel Thiel's remaining lectures:</p>
