      <h2 class="glitch" data-text="Elected">Elected</h2>
      <p>My yearlong stint on the Governing Board of my college (Cabrillo College District Board of Trustees), the Associated Student Senate, the Faculty Senate, and the Basic Needs Taskforce. I was a struggling AA student, working at a bagel shop to make ends meet and pursue my education. Serving Cabrillo College and its students in this position remains one of my proudest accomplishments to date.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organized for the institutionalization of a spanish-speaking, 1st-gen, latino/a/x graduation ceremony</li>
        <li>Got students refunded for 3rd party online grading systems</li>
        <li>Worked to secure $20,000 in funds for a college bond measure campaign</li>
        <li>Delivered yardsigns and performed speaking engagements for a college bond campaign</li>
        <li>Authored and passed a resolution which granted campus-wide student workers 3 weeks of continued pay after being laid off due to the Covid-19 shelter-in-place order</li>
        <li>Advocated and passed new Governing Board policy to pay the Student Trustee for their labor and allow them to participate in closed sessions on issues related to student discipline</li>
        <li>Advocated for the college to pursue an on-campus housing development project (now fully funded and under construction!)</li>
        <li>Funded countless student initiatives</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Student Worker Pay Resolution</h3>
      <p>I authored, organized around and passed a binding resolution that instituted the continued pay of the college's hundreds of student workers for at least three weeks during the Covid-19 pandemic, when all other workers were protected but students were not. Thanks to the resolution, we were one of only three known instances of community colleges that did this. Students reached out en masse to thank me for this policy. I am very grateful that I was able to help student workers with this resolution.</p>
      <h3>Recognition of Service Award</h3>
      <p>I received a Cabrillo College Recognition of Service Award, which included a very nice e-card, for my work on the Governing Board.</p>
      <h3>Student Housing Infrastructure Project</h3>
      <p>I was one of the first advocates for the college to pursue an on-campus housing infrastructure project to house local learners. The college and board rightfully recognized that the colleges main financial issue, reductions in state allotments as a result of decreases in the number of degrees conferred, the number of students pursuing eduction at the college on a <em>full time</em> basis and the general retention issues are largely because of local housing unaffordability. Myself and a number of associates of the college, and most importantly a number of passionate students, called on the board to begin the process of pursuing a housing infrastructure project. The beginning of that path was a feasibility study to explore costs, scale of project, location and management of the project- this feasibility study was approved by the board during my term as Student Trustee. Since then, the college has gotten the housing project (in collaboration with UCSC) fully funded with state dollars!</p>
